In order to help people understand the flow of money through the University of Alabama, we're developing a budget visualization based on [this one](http://openmaps.raleighnc.gov/budgetvisualization/) from Raleigh, NC. The source data is from [open.ua.edu](http://open.ua.edu) and the code is [here](https://github.com/CodeforTuscaloosa/Visual-UA-Budget).
