A Code for America Brigade
--------------------------

… based in Tuscaloosa, AL. AKA, The Druid City.


Mission Statement
-----------------

We aim to better the Tuscaloosa community by developing open source civic apps that make public data more accessible and useful. We believe in the power of [open data](https://okfn.org/opendata/) to make governments more transparent, engaging, and effective. Therefore we need to develop and implement an open data policy in Tuscaloosa. However we don't have to wait for that to start civic hacking&mdash; there are redeployable projects from other cities and potential projects not directly dependent on government-provided data.

We Want You
-----------

… yes, you. Anyone who is eager to make real positive changes at a local, state, or even national level, is someone we want in Code for Tuscaloosa. We are not a team of techies, we are a brigade of civilians. We’re eager to bring in anybody who values the ethic responsibilities of being a citizen. Some of us are programmers, some of us are designers, but all of us are citizens. There is plenty of meaningful work to be done for techies, and non-techies alike.


We Work like Democracy. We Work Like the Internet.
--------------------------------------------------

We think that hierarchy is a bad model for the type of work we do. We have a team of organizers, but we do not have bosses, we have leaders. Our leaders don’t delegate work, and they don’t delegate projects; they just keep everyone on rhythm. Our brigade is truly a melting pot, and we respect that. Every member of Code for Birmingham is valued and important. Every member can propose a project or an idea.
